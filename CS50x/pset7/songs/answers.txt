If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Given the following average values for the top 100 songs are:
+-------------+-------------------+--------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(danceability) | AVG(valence) |
+-------------+-------------------+--------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.71646           | 0.484443     |
+-------------+-------------------+--------------+
I would characterize the listener's audio aura as Yellow.
"Yellow: Yellows like their music to align them to the goals of their day, fueling their need for focus, motivation, and self improvement all while reducing any nerves that could get in the way."


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Other variables are missing from the table, such as instrumentalness, mode, time signature and other variables tha, included in the calculations might give a better representation of a listener's aura.
